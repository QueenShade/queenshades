# What is Reshade?
Reshade is an open-source advanced, fully generic post-processing injector for games and video. Reshade allows one to inject any D3D9, D3D10, D3D11, and OpenGL game with advanced postprocessing effects such as Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field, color correction and more. Seen those beautiful screens at the PC Screenshot or even Emulator screenshot threads? Chances are that Reshade was used to touch up the games running.

reshade just recently got updated to 4.0 which could make way for vulkan reshade in future

Queen has been working on Reshade sets for a while. Most examples of Reshades she has seen have been full of Bloom and other exaggerated effects. She wanted to go for more subtle changes, like removing horrible tints in games, maxing textures better or color correcting to enhance the atmosphere of games.

# How to set up Reshade?

1. To start, go to https://reshade.me and download the latest build. 
2. Open the exe file you just downloaded, which will bring up a box.
3. Press the select game box, which then brings up the windows filebrowser and navigate to your game's exe file. Keep in mind that some games have different executables for 32/64bit or for different renders. After selecting the executable, click Open.
4. You are now greeted with a message that asks you to select the rendering API the game uses. For DX9 games select DX9, for DX10-12 select DX10+ and OpenGL for OpenGL games. Vulkan support will come in later builds.
5. After selecting the renderer you will see a box appear, which asks you if you wish to download a collection of standard effects from github. Press Yes.
6. Next up choose all effect files you wish to install. if you're new to reshade i suggest getting all off the effects. (this will increase a games loading time by alot but obviously you will want to trial and test the effects etc and afterwards ones you dont like you can easilly delete which ill also explain in step 13
7. reshade is now technically set up and youd be good to go in game and follow below, but if like myself you have many reshade presets and using them between games etc the next option is far n wide so handy. 
8. Reshade is now technically set up and you're good to go! If everything is set up properly, you should see a message appear whenever you load a game up.
9. Once in-game, you can press home on your keyboard to start up Reshade initialization
10. After clicking continue for 3 times, you can start enabling different effects.

# Queen's presets

QueenShades are Queen's special reshade's that allow you to use my readymade reshares with just downloading the .ini file 

To set up a Queenshade, install Reshade and then navigate to the game's folder to a folder called reshade-shaders. Drop the .ini file here and you're good to go!
